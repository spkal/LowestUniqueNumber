This repository is for a simple number contest - each person in a group picks a positive integer. The person who selects the smallest value that no else in the group has selected, wins.

The initial idea for the game came from https://plus.maths.org/content/playing-number

The contest was run two times.
Once with the StatSoftFul group and once with people from my office.
